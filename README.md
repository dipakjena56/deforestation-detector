> The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can classify fire-induced deforestation events by analyzing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data. The model will identify and categorize wildfire occurrences, enabling better monitoring and management of fire-related events across differentÂ regions.
